# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaings

## Overview of Project
This project was made to help louise to analyse different crewdfundings that she is running. We will be approaching this data from different points of view by analysing all the factors that my influence on how successful the campaing my be. After this analysis, we will have an idea of how different scenarios influence in the behavior of every campaing. We will be using excel to try to organize the data in a way what we will understand it better and have a better view of it.

### Purpose
The purpuse of this project is to analyse differents aspect of the campaing to identify why some campaings are not working and what can be done to improve them.

## Analysis and Challenges
The first step tha we took to be able to make this analysis was to know the data we were working with, getting to know everything about the workbook since how many rowws and colums we had to filter the different categories and subcategories to be able to understand what we were working with. We had to make the data as easy to understand as we could.

By organizing the data, we got to have an idea of how close was each campaing to reach their goal. We crated a new column with this information to get a sence of how close was the campaing to meet the goal or for what porcentage it overpassed it. 

Pivot tables were a really helpful tool to make the data visualization better, we found that there were 525 successful theater campaings out of 912 thearer campaings which are more than 50% as it may be seen in the following chart.

In the following chart we can see what are the most successful months for the campaing. Those months are January, June, July and October

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the chart, the best month to launch a campaing is may since it is the month with more successful campaings.

### Analysis of Outcome Based on Goals

As we take a look at the chart we can see how the higher the goal was the harder it was to reach it. You can see how the most successful campaings were those with lower goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Personally, the challenge i encounter is at the time of writting the findings. I understand what i am doing and the results that my analysis is throwing out but at the time of putting it in words is when the challenge comes
